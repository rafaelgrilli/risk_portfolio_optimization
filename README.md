# risk_portfolio_optimization
With this repository I use PyPortfolioOpt, a Python library for portfolio optimization, to show possible applications of the tool in portfolio management. 
I follow PyPortfolioOpt User Guide to go through calculatios of: 
1. Processing historical prices
2. Efficient Frontier Optimization (based on Harry Markowitz's 1952 classic paper)
2.1 Efficient Frontier allowing short positions and other constraints 
3. Improving performance:
3.1 Hierarchical Risk Parity Model - which may robustly outperform mean-variance optimization out of sample
3.2 Use the Black-Literman model to construct a more stable model of expected returns
3.3 Other models
